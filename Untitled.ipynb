    "Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationship between cause and effect.\n",

    "Ohm's Law is a linear relationship -> v = iR\n",

    "Homogeneity property:\n",
    "If the current is increased by a constant k -> the voltage is also increased by that value k\n",
    "\n",
    "Additive property:\n",
    "The response to a sum of inputs is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately\n",
    "$$v_1 = i_1*R \\qquad v_2 = i_2*R$$\n",
    "then applying ($i_1 + i_2$)\n",
    "$$v = (i_1+i_2)R = i_1*R+i_2*R = v_1+v_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear circuit is one whose output is linearly related\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the equation for power is quadratic\n",
    "$$ P = i^2R = \\frac{v^2}{R}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the relationship between voltage and power or current and power is nonlinear.\n",
