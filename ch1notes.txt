Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists,
measured in coulombs
    - most basic quantity in an electric currrent

Law of Conservation of Charge - Charge can neither be created or destroyed -
    only transferred.

Electrical Current = dq/dt
    i = dq/dt units C/s

Direcet Current (DC) current flows in only one direction

Alternating Current (AC) current that changes direction with respect to time

The voltage between two points a and b in an electric circuit is the energy (or
work) needed to move a unit charge from b to a

v_ab = dw/dq = units joules per coulomb-> w is energy in joules(J) and q is 
chargew in coulombs

Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in watts(W)

p = dw/dt = dw/dq * dq/dt = vi ---> p = v

positive power is power being delivered to or absorbed by the element.

negative power is power being supplied by the object.

Current direction and voltage polarity play a major role in determining the sign
of power.

Pasive sign convention is satisfied when the current enters through the positive
terminal of an element and p = +vi - If the current enters through the negative 
terminal, p = -vi

Law of conservation of energy -> sum(p) = 0

work = w = integral(p*dt
) = integral(v*i*dt)
