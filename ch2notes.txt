Basic Laws

Ohm's law = the voltage across a resistor is directly proportional to the current
flowing through the resistor

        v = i*R

Resistance - R - of an element denotes its ability to resist the flow of electric
current; measured in ohms

        R = v/i
        1 ohm =  1 V/A

Current must flow from higher voltage to lower voltage in order for v = iR
Current must flow from lower voltage to higher voltage in order for v = -iR

An element with R = 0 is called a short circuit

An element with R = inf is called an open circuit

Resistor is either fixed or variable (potentiometer or pot)

The reciprocal of resistance R is known as conductance Good

        G = 1/R = i/v
        1 S = 1 \invertedOmega = 1 A/V
Conductance is a measure of how well an element will conduct electric current

The power dissipated by a resistor is:
        p = vi = i^2R = v^2/R
        p = vi = v^2G = i^2/G

2.5 : Series Resistors and VOltage Division
---------------------------------------------------
Equivalent Resistance --> Any number of resistors connected in series is the sum
of the individual resistances

sum(R) = R_eq

2.6 : Parallel Resistors and Current Division
---------------------------------------------------
Equivalent Conductance --> Any number of resistors connected in parallel is the sum
of their individual conductances

sum(G) = G_eq
