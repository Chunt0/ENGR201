-------------

Learning Objectives:
    - Ohm's law -> V = i*R
    - Understand nodes, loops, and branches
    - Kirchoff's Law -> ?
    - Series and voltagwe division and parallel resistances and current division
    - Know how to convert delta-connected circuits to wye-connected circuits and 
        how to convert wye-connected circuits to delta-connected circuits.

All real matter has some resistance

- The strength with which a material resists the flow of current is known as its 
    resistivity which has the symbol row and has units of ohm-meters

Conductors have low resitivity!

Insulators have high resistivity!

-------------------------------------

Ohm's Law!

Voltage and current are proportional!

v = i*R

ohm = Volts/Amp

- Resistors will always cause a voltage drop (absorb power) because a resistor 
converts energy to heat by restriction of current flow (friction). 

Ohm's Law only applies to resistors!

p = vi = (iR)i = i^2*R   or  p = vi = v(v/R) = v^2/R

Current will always enter the positive end of a resistor!

-------------------------------------

Open Circuits:

When R = inf

i = 0 for any v
p = 0
Line on y-axis of IV-graph

Short Circuits:

When R = 0

v = 0 for any i
p = 0
Line on x-axis axis of IV-graph

This is how a switch operates!

------------------------------------

Non-linear Resistors

- Photoresistors (light dependent)
- Thermistors (temp dependent)
- Strain gauges (force dependent)
- Varistors (voltage dependent)

-----------------------------------

Conductance

- The ability of an element to conduct electric current

Inverse of Resistance:

G = 1/R

Units are A/V or a Siemens (S)

G = i/voltage

or 

i = Gv

p = v^2*G =
